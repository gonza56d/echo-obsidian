# Kforce "Last Contacted By" filter 500s (PR 1846 + PR 1850)

FE reported the contacts "Last Contacted By" dropdown showing "No options found" on kforce — `GET /users?...&has_contact_interaction=true` returned **500 after ~20.7s**. Took TWO rounds to actually fix.

## Round 1 — [#1846](https://github.com/taller-projects/echo-backend/pull/1846) (merged 2026-07-16, insufficient)

Root cause was dual:

1. **Dropdown 500** — `User.has_contact_interaction` ranked EVERY `contact_interaction` row with `row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY contact_id)` → full-table window scan → statement timeout. Rewritten to `id IN (SELECT ...)` via the denormalized **`Contact.last_interaction_id` pointer**.
2. **Latent applied-filter 500** — dev commit `00fdc79e` ([[UUID typing for id__in filters (23253)]]) was never ported; malformed `last_interaction__created_by_id__in` → `InvalidTextRepresentation` 500. Ported copy+adapt.

**Why it wasn't enough**: the 0.26s benchmark only covered the **page query** (LIMIT 50 → ~67 user rows evaluated). fastapi-pagination also runs a **count query over all 11,393 org users**; the planner estimates the IN subquery at ~1.5M rows (contact count), refuses a hashed subplan (`work_mem`), and rescans a materialized subplan per user row → count exceeds even a 2-min timeout. The `(expr) = true` wrapper emitted by `fastapi_filter` also blocks semi-join conversion. Confirmed live post-deploy (build `24619_kforce-dev`): still 500 at ~20.5s, Grafana traceback dies in `fastapi_pagination ... _total_flow`.

## Round 2 — [#1850](https://github.com/taller-projects/echo-backend/pull/1850) → kforce-dev ([Bug 23638](https://dev.azure.com/TallerInternTools/Echo%20Core/_workitems/edit/23638), in review)

- `has_contact_interaction` reshaped to **nested EXISTS** (`EXISTS(ci WHERE created_by_id=u.id AND EXISTS(contact WHERE last_interaction_id=ci.id))`) → planner keeps per-user index probes.
- New index **`contact_last_interaction_id_idx`** on `contact(last_interaction_id)` (migration `d829nrzr6hik`) — the existing composite `(tenant_id, last_interaction_id)` leads with `tenant_id` and can't serve the probe.
- Validated on real kforce-dev data with `BEGIN; CREATE INDEX; EXPLAIN ANALYZE <exact ORM-compiled SQL>; ROLLBACK`: count **>2min timeout → 201ms**.

## Decisions

- **Rejected set-based shapes** (all recompute the 1.5M×2.2M contact↔interaction join per request): `IN (SELECT DISTINCT ...)` 5.9s, de-correlated `EXISTS` 4.0s. Only per-user index probes are ms-class. Volumes: 1.52M contacts / 2.2M interactions / 11,393 org users / only ~4.4k distinct "last contacted by" creators.
- **Plain index over reusing the tenant_id composite**: kforce's vestigial single-valued `contact.tenant_id` could have served the probe via `tenant_id = user.organization_id`, but that couples the filter to a vestige a future cleanup may drop. Explicit index is 1 cheap migration (~2s build at 1.5M rows).
- EXISTS is inherently immune to the NULL three-valued-logic trap the IN form needed a `created_by_id IS NOT NULL` guard for.

## Gotchas

- **Always benchmark the pagination COUNT query, not just the page query** — `paginate()` runs both; LIMIT hides per-row subplan disasters.
- Kforce DB **retains `tenant_id` columns/indexes** on `contact` (schema vestige of the fork) even though kforce code is single-tenant — don't trust CLAUDE.md's "no tenant_id anywhere" for the DB layer.
- Local pytest "role `test` does not exist" = exported `POSTGRES_*` vars from `set -a; source .env` hijack the testcontainer login role. Use `.env` as a FILE in cwd, never export it.

## FE contract (both envs)

- Dropdown options: `GET /users?has_contact_interaction=true(&organization_id&full_name__ilike)`; applied filter: `last_interaction__created_by_id__in`; hydration: per-id `GET /users/{id}`. Unchanged by both rounds.

## Taller port — [#1851](https://github.com/taller-projects/echo-backend/pull/1851) → dev ([Bug 23639](https://dev.azure.com/TallerInternTools/Echo%20Core/_workitems/edit/23639), in review)

Preventive port of the round-2 shape (2026-07-17): dev still ran the ORIGINAL `row_number()` window and was closer to the cliff than assumed — the count query already took **11.8s of the ~20s timeout budget on dev data** (82k contacts / 544k interactions / 830 users). Ported: nested EXISTS + `contact_last_interaction_id_idx` (migration `51r81g9s8arp`, chained onto the current dev head `3gufg5ykw01g` — see Review + fixes) + the full regression test suite adapted to Taller tenancy (`mocked_tenant`, `tenant_id` on Interaction, no `organization_id` in Taller's `UserFilter`). Validated same rolled-back-index method: **11.8s → 41ms**. Also a deliberate semantic alignment: the window ranked by interaction date independently of the `last_interaction_id` pointer, so dropdown and applied filter could disagree; now both join through the pointer.

### Review + fixes (2026-07-17)

`/pr-review 1851` (architecture + prd + tests-security) caught a **latent alembic multi-head**: `51r81g9s8arp` was cut off `q8vd3mzk7w2p`, but dev's head had since advanced to `3gufg5ykw01g` (interview change-history backfill, [[Interview assessment change history (US 22248)]]). CI was green only because the PR branch predated `3gufg5ykw01g`, so its chain looked single-headed in isolation — merged into dev it would leave **two heads** and break `alembic upgrade head` (same class of pipeline break as the contact-relationship column-drop). Fixes pushed as commit `fc5876cf`:

- **Rebased** the migration `down_revision` `q8vd3mzk7w2p` → `3gufg5ykw01g` (merged `origin/dev` into the branch; single head re-verified with `alembic heads`).
- **Concurrent index build**: wrapped `create_index`/`drop_index` in `op.get_context().autocommit_block()` + `postgresql_concurrently=True`. `contact` is large/write-hot and a plain in-tx CREATE INDEX holds ACCESS EXCLUSIVE — self-defeating for a prod-safety fix. Matches the `add_tags_to_contact` (`fqjptb8sl7vh`) precedent. NB: only 3 of ~146 index migrations use CONCURRENTLY — emerging convention for big tables, not universal.
- **Nit — explicit tenant scoping**: added `Interaction.tenant_id == cls.tenant_id` to the outer EXISTS (defense-in-depth alongside RLS, matching the `is_owner` column_property; redundant with RLS but the house idiom).
- **Nit — test page-1 robustness**: pinned `size=100` on the `has_contact_interaction=false` requests (module-scoped DB accumulates users; default page 50 could push the target off page 1).
- Deliberately **skipped** the "add RLS DDL-assertion test" nit — the RLS policies on `contact`/`contact_interaction` are pre-existing and unchanged by this PR, so out of scope.

Verified: 7 ported + 150 user/filter tests green; ruff clean; single alembic head. Review verdict CHANGES REQUESTED → now addressed.

## Pending

- **[#1850](https://github.com/taller-projects/echo-backend/pull/1850) merge + kforce-dev deploy + live re-test** of the dropdown.
- **[#1851](https://github.com/taller-projects/echo-backend/pull/1851) merge** (Taller dev) — review fixes pushed (`fc5876cf`), awaiting merge; then qa/main promotion via release flow.
- kforce-master promotion via normal release flow.
